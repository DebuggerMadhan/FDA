# Welcome to F D A


Dance is not only excellent exercise, a means for expression, but also gives one the opportunity to learn about an art form from the inside. The wonderful thing about learning dance it, anyone can partake. It’s ever so easy and definitely a FUN way of keeping fit for all ages. If your stressed or depressed or simply strut your stuff. No need for partner or any previous dancing experience.

Here, The Flash Dance Academy is a special place…
          Where dance training is safe, challenging and an enjoyable experience that can yield results. Our aim is to bring person and to develop the creative dimension as well as promote complete fitness and sense of well-being through dance. Class sizes are limited so that every dancer receives personal care and attention to develop their performing arts skill to their full potential. Classes are available to children from the age of 3.
          
3-5 year olds: For the little ones, the emphasis is on having fun moving to music with others and on play-acting, while learning many of the basic free style, creative dance moves and how to use their bodies with co-ordination and confidence.

6-14 year olds: For this group, the fun continues in a more structured way. In addition, there are graded classes offered in rock ‘n’ roll, hip-hop, jazz. Those students who are just dancing to enjoy themselves grow in poise, confidence, and self-esteem.

Teens: At this level, students may pursue serious pre-professional training, or again, just dance for the fun of it. We offer a full curriculum of extreme hip-hop, modern jazz, Latin etc., at this level.

Adults: We’re fortunate to have a group of dedicated adults students (yes, some are parents of our younger dancers) who enjoy the challenge, the fitness, and as some say, the reversal of the aging process. We offer adult classes for beginners through very advanced levels in free style, bollywood,ballroom, latin, creative, and modern so there’s something for everyone.




Students are always welcome at all levels.
